### 6. Accessibility Tests

#### `should have proper ARIA labels and accessibility features`
**Purpose**: Ensures application is accessible to all users
**What it tests**:
- Semantic HTML elements are used correctly
- Form controls have proper labels
- Buttons have accessible text or aria-labels

- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible

### 7. Responsive Design Tests

#### `should maintain responsiveness across different screen sizes`
**Purpose**: Tests mobile and desktop compatibility
**What it tests**:
- Desktop layout displays correctly
- Mobile layout adapts appropriately
- Components resize properly
- All features work on different screen sizes

### 8. Data Integrity Tests

#### `should correctly filter sites based on multiple criteria`
**Purpose**: Tests business logic accuracy
**What it tests**:
- Multiple filter criteria work together (AND logic)
- Filter combinations produce correct results
- No data corruption during filtering

#### `should correctly calculate and display site statistics`
**Purpose**: Ensures data calculations are accurate
**What it tests**:
- Site counts are correct
- Department counts are accurate
- Statistics reflect actual data
- Numbers are reasonable and positive

#### `should maintain search functionality with complex queries`
**Purpose**: Tests search algorithm robustness
**What it tests**:
- Partial matching works correctly
- Case-insensitive search functions
- Search across different data fields
- Complex queries return appropriate results

## Test Execution

### Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all integration tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern=integration

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage -- --testPathPattern=integration

# Run in watch mode for development
npm test -- --testPathPattern=integration --watch
```

### Expected Outcomes

1. **All tests should pass**: No failures indicate the application works correctly
2. **High coverage**: Integration tests should cover major user workflows
3. **Performance benchmarks met**: Render times and operation speeds within limits
4. **Accessibility compliance**: All accessibility tests pass
5. **Security validation**: No XSS vulnerabilities or input handling issues

## Debugging Failed Tests

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Timeout Errors**: 
   - Check if async operations need more time
   - Verify waitFor conditions are correct
   - Ensure components render completely

2. **Element Not Found**:
   - Verify text content matches exactly
   - Check if elements are conditionally rendered
   - Ensure proper wait conditions

3. **State Issues**:
   - Verify context providers are properly set up
   - Check if state updates are properly awaited
   - Ensure cleanup between tests

4. **Performance Test Failures**:
   - Adjust time thresholds for test environment
   - Check for memory leaks
   - Verify mock implementations

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

When adding new features, ensure:
1. Happy path integration tests are added
2. Error cases are covered
3. Performance impact is tested
4. Accessibility is verified

### Updating Existing Tests

When modifying features:
1. Update test assertions to match new behavior
2. Verify all related tests still pass
3. Add tests for new edge cases
4. Update documentation if test purposes change

This comprehensive test suite ensures the Intelligence Industrielle application is robust, performant, accessible, and secure across all major user workflows.
